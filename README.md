# Kanban Board (CCA-001 Final Project)

The objective of this project is to create a simple Kanban board simulator using Python lists. The program will allow users to create and manage tasks, and move them through different stages of completion.

# Features

+ **Task Creation:** create tasks with a description and assign them to a stage (e.g. "backlog", "doing", "review", "done")
+ **Task Management:** allow users to add, remove, and update tasks
+ **Kanban Board Display:** Uses print statements to return a visual representation of the current state of the Kanban board, including the tasks in each stage
